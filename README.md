# Advent of Code 2022 solutions
## About
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2022. I used Python
and chose to write in a clean, readable, production style rather
than optimising for efficiency. 

At the time of starting, I'm experienced with
Java and JS/TypeScript but very new to Python
so code may not be idiomatic to start with but
do hope to be writing great code
by the end.
